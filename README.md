* Gamification: Built-in Memory Game developed with custom logic to improve cognitive skills and user retention.
* Sustainability Module: Encourages and tracks eco-friendly daily habits.

##  Tech Stack
* Language: Java (Core Logic & OOP Principles).
* Interface: Android XML Layouts.
* IDE: Android Studio.
* Version Control: Git & GitHub.

##  Technical Implementation
* Implemented Object-Oriented Programming principles to manage the complex state of the Memory Game.
* Designed custom XML layouts to ensure a responsive and user-friendly experience.
* Structured the project following standard Android development practices for scalability.
